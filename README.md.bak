# Life_Insurance_WebSite
By Noel Carrascal

When prospecting life insurance clients, it is important to cast a wide net.
I developed this site as a prospecting tool when working as a life insurance
agent. The website goal is to educate people, who are looking for life insurance,
and allow them to contact an agent associated with the website, and to make an 
appointment and discuss the purchase of life insurance.
 
The philosophy of the website is more subtle than its goal. it is to
empower people so that they make a more informed decision when reviewing
recommendations made to them by an agent. It is the experience of the
designer of the website, that most people can not absorb all the concepts
necessary to select the right type of life insurance. Often they just
trust the agent recommendation without having a full understanding of the
available products and riders on the market. This has led to less than
ideal purchases of life insurance products by clients. If a website is design
to bring people's life insurance knowledge up before meeting 
an agent, a person could better process a larger number of variables
when picking an insurance product presented to them by an agent.

The website works like a slide show using tabs as navigational guides.
It introduces life insurance concepts in simple terms. Still, the site
is very busy in terms of text. This is the minimum amount of information
that I could put so that Google Adwords approved an ad. I know that too
much text could be something that drove people away from the website.
Yet, in sales there is a common 20-80 rule. Eighty percent of the people
just go with an agent's recommendation, and twenty percent want to fully
understand what they want before agreeing to an agents recommendation.

With this in mind, this site has two goals: To target that twenty percent 
of people who love being sufficiently informed, and to increase that
twenty percent to a higher number because knowledge is power.

The website starts in an unsecured page. It the jumps to an ssl directory
that is secured by the internet service provider. That way, all data is
encripted before transmition.

The web site is fully functionala and it can be found at the following URL:

This website was approved by Google Adwords and produced leads. Yet, it is
obvious that the website is in an early stage of development, actually the
very first one, and could be enhance in term of presentation and concept.
There is also a question of trust. Why would anyone leave their information
on this website? Brand recognition is one answer. I needed to include logos
of well known insurance companies and perhaps the face of an agent. But I 
was not allowed by my comapny to place my contact information or their
comapany logo on the website.

For this website to be more effective, I need to either improve brand recognition
or gu under the 'umbrella' of a recognized company that approves the use
of their logo on my website in exchange for recomending their line of products
to prospective clients.
