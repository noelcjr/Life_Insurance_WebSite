      "I had a vague idea of life insurance concepts before I visited this web site. NYlifeinsurancequote.info 
       opened up my mind to concpets that i did not know. When I met with the agent, our conversation was more
       productive." A. J. S. Hempstead, NY.<br><br>

      "I always thought that the way to buy protect my family and save for retirenment to buy term insurance 
      and invest the rest. When I read about variable life insurance policies, how they combine both protection
      and investment, with tax-deferred in capital gains, I realized that my initial thoughts were outdated.
      Thank you for helping me make the most out of my money." T. S. Huntington, NY.<br><br>

      "When my mother died and I received a death benefit from her, I only knew two things about life insurance: 
       her policy set me financially for life, and I did not know mucho else about life insurance. I realized how 
       important is life insurance, and I wanted my children to be protected. I had to learn more about life 
       insurance, and I got a quick overview after reading the concepts tab. I had many questions about life 
       insurance that applied exclusively to my situation that were answered to me when I met with the agent. That 
       was very easy because this site gave a strong foundation."  A. J. R. Brooklyn, NY.<br><br>  

      "I had met with another agent before reading this website, and all he did was put fear, not answers, 
       in mi head. I felt so unprepared and unable to understand all the consecuences of his recomendation
       that I decided to postpone my purchase of life insurance until I informed myself better. There is plenty
       of information on the web, but rarely succint and to the point. This website help me sort out my 
       thought and I felt more confortable with the life insurance I got from the same agent." C. Z. Bronx, NY. <br><br>
