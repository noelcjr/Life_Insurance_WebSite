# Life_Insurance_WebSite
When prospecting life insurance clients, it is important to cast a wide net.
This website is intended as an educational aid to inform people about life
insurance before meeting with an agent. The philosophy of the website is to
empower people so that they make a more informed decision...

The website works like a slide show using tabs as navigational guides.
It introduces life insurance concepts in simple terms. Still, the site
is very busy in terms of text. This is the minimum amount of information
that I could put so that Google Adwords aproved an ad.
